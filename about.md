By day I'm a Full Stack Developer at [Potato](https://p.ota.to), making websites for the biggest tech brands. By night I develop games and play with functional programming, occasionally at the same time.

My current big project is a multiplayer digital card game called Hubris. You can [play it](https://playhubris.com) or [peruse the source](https://github.com/RoganMurley/hubris).
