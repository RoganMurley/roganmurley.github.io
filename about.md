By day I'm a Software Engineer at [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com) working on the video player. By night I develop games and play with functional programming, occasionally at the same time.

My current big project is a multiplayer digital card game called Ring of Worlds. You can [play it](https://www.ringofworlds.com) or [peruse the source](https://github.com/RoganMurley/Ring-of-Worlds).
