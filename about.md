I'm a Senior Staff Engineer at [Reddit](https://www.redditinc.com/) working on User Acquisition.

By day I tackle complex engineering challenges at scale. By night I develop games and play with functional programming, occasionally at the same time.

I'm working on a wiki that makes games. Join the waitlist at [langengine.com](https://www.langengine.com/).

I made a multiplayer digital card game called GALGA with Haskell and Elm. You can [play it](https://www.galgagame.com) or [peruse the source](https://github.com/RoganMurley/GALGAGAME).
