I'm a Senior Software Engineer at [Reddit](https://www.redditinc.com/), previously [Udemy](https://about.udemy.com/) and [Potato](https://p.ota.to/).

By day I tackle complex engineering challenges at scale. By night I develop games and play with functional programming, occasionally at the same time.

My current big project is a multiplayer digital card game called Ring of Worlds. You can [play it](https://www.ringofworlds.com) or [peruse the source](https://github.com/RoganMurley/Ring-of-Worlds).
